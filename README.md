pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Update Azure OpenAI API Keys File

In the file called `keys.py` present in the root folder of the project, add you keys:

```python
keys = {
    "service_id": "your_service_id",
    "deployment_name": "your_gpt_deployment_name",
    "endpoint": "https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/",
    "api_key": "your_azure_openai_api_key"
}
```

> 🔒 **Important**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure OpenAI credentials.

### ✅ Step 5: Configure Email Settings

Open the file `agentic_sk.py` and locate the `send_email()` function.

Update the following:

```python
"senderAddress": "DoNotReply@xxxxxxx.azurecomm.net",  # Your verified Azure sender address
"recipients": {
    "to": [{"address": "you@example.com", "displayName": "Your Name"}]
